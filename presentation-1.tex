%------------------------------------------------------------
% Paradigm Shift Slide 1
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Before we focus on the mechanics of building pipelines, let’s understand the bigger picture:
% Generative AI is at a stage similar to the early days of the internet. Back then, people doubted the internet’s value and called it a bubble. Many focused inward, building internal tools without truly reaching real users.
% But as history shows, the internet’s value soared 1000 times beyond initial estimates.
%
% Today, GenAI is following a similar arc. Success doesn’t hinge on having the most advanced models alone; it depends on distributing solutions widely, earning trust, and integrating AI seamlessly into daily workflows.
% Embrace this mindset, because trust and ethics are the real keys to unlocking GenAI’s immense potential.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{A New Paradigm: GenAI as the Next Internet}
\begin{itemize}
\item GenAI echoes the early internet’s journey from ``bubble'' to massive value
\item Emphasize trust, distribution, and integration over mere technical sophistication
\item Acknowledge ethics and fairness as central pillars of sustainable AI success
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{We stand at a turning point where human-centric values matter more than ever.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% Paradigm Shift Slide 2
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Like early internet skeptics who never reached beyond internal initiatives, many organizations today invest heavily in internal AI tools but fail to deliver widely adopted, user-facing solutions.
%
% Real impact springs from delivering user-facing features that people trust and rely on. This is not just about having powerful models; it’s about putting them in people’s hands, building trust, and integrating AI into everyday workflows.
%
% We’ll share insights once locked away in executive workshops and show how even non-tech companies can surpass tech giants by leveraging their existing trust and customer relationships.
%
% Our approach isn’t just about coding and tools; it’s about forging an ethical, scalable, and user-centered ML ecosystem that endures.

% Who Leads in AI?
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Let's begin with a question that might surprise you:
%
% Picture two industry giants:
% \textbf{IBM}: Decades of AI experience, global infrastructure, thousands of researchers, and billions in R&D.
%
% \textbf{JPMorgan Chase}: A traditional bank running on legacy systems, with a limited AI research team, no major AI product launches, and a highly regulated environment.
%
% Which one is better positioned to dominate AI?
%
% Here’s what’s fascinating: It’s actually JPMorgan Chase.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{Who is better positioned to lead in AI?}
\begin{columns}
\column{0.45\textwidth}
\textbf{IBM:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decades of AI leadership
\item Vast R\&D resources
\item Global infrastructure
\item Thousands of top-tier researchers
\end{itemize}

\column{0.45\textwidth}
\textbf{JPMorgan Chase:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional, legacy banking systems
\item Limited internal AI expertise
\item Highly regulated environment
\item No significant AI products yet
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{The answer may surprise you—let’s find out why.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% The Surprising AI Leader
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Why JPMorgan Chase? Because they have something even more powerful than cutting-edge tech: millions of real users who trust them daily.
%
% This trust and massive user base create a ready-made distribution channel. AI models can be sourced or rented, but forging trust and embedding solutions into daily life is far tougher.
%
% This reframes what it means to be “good at AI.” It’s not just about R&D; it’s about reaching users, integrating seamlessly, and building on existing customer relationships.
%
% By prioritizing trust and distribution, you can achieve real-world impact. This is the key insight: The hardest part isn’t building brilliant models—it’s getting them into people’s hands.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{Paradigm Shift in Leadership}
\begin{itemize}
\item JPMorgan’s massive, trusting user base outweighs raw R\&D might
\item AI models are accessible; trust and user reach are the real differentiators
\item Real impact: Getting tech into users’ hands, leveraging existing relationships
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{We must design pipelines that prioritize trust, integration, and real-world adoption.}

% ML Production Challenges - Part 1
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% So what does it take to push ML into production?
%
% Data scientists often have stellar models in their notebooks. But productionizing them means creating stable preprocessing pipelines, implementing model version tracking, meeting strict security standards, and working under regulatory scrutiny.
%
% We’re great at building “race cars” (models) but haven’t focused as much on building the “roads” (infrastructure).
%
% The solution? A holistic toolset that makes these tasks routine, scalable, and ethically sound, freeing you to focus on innovation rather than reinventing the wheel every time.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{The ML Production Challenge (1/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex preprocessing steps need standardization, not ad-hoc scripts
\item Model versioning \& tracking ensure accountability, reproducibility, trust
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{Bridging research and production demands careful planning, not heroics.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% ML Production Challenges - Part 2
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Add security, compliance, and the demands of regulated environments, and it grows even more complex. In finance, healthcare, or government, every step faces extra checks.
%
% Without robust pipelines, even the best models can languish in a lab environment, never truly changing the world.
%
% Our mission: transform this complexity into a coherent, automated system where fairness and ethics are built-in. That way, you can handle challenges confidently, knowing your pipelines are solid, secure, and socially responsible.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{The ML Production Challenge (2/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Security \& compliance: must-haves, not afterthoughts
\item Regulated environments magnify complexity \& oversight
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{We need robust pipelines—``roads''—to let our ``race car'' models truly shine.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% Comprehensive Pipeline & Responsibility - Part 1
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% The answer? A comprehensive, automated pipeline that tackles complexity head-on.
%
% Automation reduces manual effort and errors. It ensures consistent preprocessing, reproducible training runs, and streamlined deployments.
%
% But remember: Automation without responsibility can amplify biases. If our preprocessing code introduces an unintended bias, automation will spread it everywhere.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{Toward a Comprehensive, Ethical Pipeline (1/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Embrace automation: reduce manual effort across preprocessing, training, deployment
\item Aim for stable, reproducible processes with minimal human intervention
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{Speed is good, but doing it ethically and responsibly is transformative.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% Comprehensive Pipeline & Responsibility - Part 2
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Hence, we integrate bias detection and fairness checks into our pipeline.
%
% Model training isn’t just about accuracy—it’s about fairness and transparency. Deployment isn’t just about scaling—it’s about secure, compliant, and ethical release.
%
% Continuous monitoring ensures that as data shifts, performance and fairness remain intact.
%
% This holistic approach weaves ethical considerations into every decision, guaranteeing that our ML systems don’t just function—they function ethically and equitably.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{Toward a Comprehensive, Ethical Pipeline (2/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrate bias checks early to prevent injustice downstream
\item Include fairness metrics, not just accuracy or speed
\item Secure, ethical deployment and continuous fairness monitoring
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Hugging Face Spaces}: Effortless model deployment \& user interfaces
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}
\emph{These tools represent fundamental pillars for robust, user-centric, and ethical ML deployments.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% Ethical Foundations - Part 1
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% Now, the ethical dimension:
%
% Automation can silently embed our assumptions about the world. If our dataset is skewed, our automated preprocessing can magnify bias. If we measure only accuracy, we might ignore fairness.
%
% Ethical AI requires acknowledging these pitfalls and building guardrails. Fairness metrics become as important as performance metrics. Documentation and transparency practices ensure we understand each decision embedded in the pipeline.
%
% Many real-world incidents have shown how ``biased'' or ``unethical'' AI systems harm people and reputations. Our goal is to prevent such outcomes by integrating ethical principles from the start.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
\begin{frame}{Ethical Foundations (1/2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automation can propagate hidden biases into every stage
\item Ethical AI requires deliberate fairness metrics \& transparent processes
\item Real-world scandals show the cost of neglecting these principles
\end{itemize}

\emph{Ethical considerations must be embedded in every decision, every line of code.}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------
% Ethical Foundations - Part 2
%------------------------------------------------------------
%%% VOICEOVER ON
% We’ll integrate fairness checks, privacy safeguards, and accountability mechanisms.
%
% Responsible AI isn’t a luxury or a late-stage add-on—it’s an expectation. Our pipelines will have built-in bias detection, audit trails, human oversight for critical decisions, and compliance checks where required.
%
% By doing so, we ensure that as our ML capabilities scale, they don’t compromise the very trust and user relationships we’ve worked so hard to cultivate.
%%% VOICEOVER OFF
