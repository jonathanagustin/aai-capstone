fairness_check.py

This snippet provides a pseudo-code example of checking fairness by comparing performance
across privileged and unprivileged groups. In a real scenario, you'd integrate AIF360 or
other fairness tools and measure disparate impact or equalized odds.

Key concepts:
- Evaluating model performance on subgroups
- Detecting bias before deployment
- Blocking unethical model deployments

    Compare model performance on privileged vs. unprivileged groups.
    If ratio drops below a threshold, flag potential bias.

        pipeline: A trained model or pipeline with a .score method.
